Description: The CommonMark specification defines a rationalized version of markdown
    syntax. This package uses the 'cmark' reference implementation for converting
    markdown text into various formats including html, latex and groff man. In
    addition it exposes the markdown parse tree in xml format. The latest version of
    this package also adds support for Github extensions including tables, autolinks
    and strikethrough text.
